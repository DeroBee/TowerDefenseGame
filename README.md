# TowerDefenseGame
A tower defense game made with Unity. This follows the tutorial at [raywenderlich.com](https://www.raywenderlich.com/269-how-to-create-a-tower-defense-game-in-unity-part-1)

Besides learning how to do stuff in unity, I'm also creating all sprites myself because I want to create some kind of workflow for creating basic placeholder sprites.
